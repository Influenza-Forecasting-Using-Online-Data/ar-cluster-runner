Result: The series is stationary

Interpretation:
- hypothesis(H0): assume trend stationary
- since 0.04 < 0.34, 0.46, 0.57, 0.73 => null hypothesis can NOT be rejected
- p > 0.05 => 0.1 probability that H0 will be rejected
 => H0 has ~0.9% probability to NOT be rejected

===> data is stationary

*** no unit root != trend-stationarity, BUT unit root == non-stationarity
