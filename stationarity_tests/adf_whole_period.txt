ADF Statistic: -6.966726
p-value: 0.000000
lags: 6
observations: 549
Critical Values:
	1%: -3.442
	5%: -2.867
	10%: -2.570
Result: The series is stationary


Interpretation:
- hypothesis(H0): has unit root => assume non-stationarity
- since -6.96 < -3.4, -2.8, -2.5 => null hypothesis can be rejected
- p < 0.05 => 0% probability that H0 will not be rejected
 => H0 has ~100% probability to be rejected

===> dataset is stationary

*** no unit root != trend-stationarity, BUT unit root == non-stationarity
